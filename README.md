# [Common Utilities](https://yowainwright.gitbook.io/common-utilities/) ðŸ§°

#### No cruft. No bloat. No dependencies.

Simple, typed, functional, documented, and tested utility functions for JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, Go, and Rust.

## Project Structure

This monorepo contains utilities implemented in multiple languages. Each utility is organized as:

```
utilities/
â”œâ”€â”€ [utility-name]/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ ts/      # TypeScript implementation
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ py/      # Python implementation
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ go/      # Go implementation
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ rust/    # Rust implementation
```

## Utilities

Listed below are currently available utilities. More are on the way!

## Up Next

Here are 10 less common but useful utilities planned for implementation:

1. **memoize** - Cache function results for expensive computations
2. **chunk** - Split arrays into smaller arrays of specified size
3. **clamp** - Constrain a number between minimum and maximum values
4. **retry** - Retry failed operations with exponential backoff
5. **partition** - Split an array into two based on a predicate function
6. **zip** - Combine multiple arrays into tuples
7. **flatten** - Recursively flatten nested arrays to specified depth
8. **pick** - Create object with only specified properties
9. **omit** - Create object excluding specified properties
10. **sleep** - Promise-based delay utility for async operations

Each utility will be implemented in TypeScript, Python, Go, and Rust following the same patterns as existing utilities.
